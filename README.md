# Artificial Intelligence Practicals

This repository contains a collection of practical lab exercises related to **Artificial Intelligence**.  
Each practical focuses on implementing and understanding core AI algorithms and concepts.

## 📚 Contents
The practicals typically include:
- Explanation of the algorithm or concept
- Step-by-step implementation
- Input/output demonstration
- Observations or conclusions

## 🧠 Topics Covered (examples)
- Search Algorithms (DFS, BFS, A*)
- Knowledge Representation
- Predicate Logic & Inference
- Machine Learning Algorithms (e.g., Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees)
- Neural Networks (Basics)
- Fuzzy Logic / Expert Systems (If applicable)

> *Note:* The exact set of practicals may vary depending on syllabus or course requirements.

## 🛠️ Tools / Technologies Used
- Programming Language: **Python** (or specify another)
- IDE / Notebooks: **Jupyter Notebook**, Google Colab, or standard editor
- Libraries (optional): NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, etc.
